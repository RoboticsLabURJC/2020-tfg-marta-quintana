2. Increase the precision of Neural Network Acustic Teleoperator --> More Examples, Walkie Talkie other models. --> I tried and I saw videos but I don't have it yet. I found Teachable Machine by Google (with tensorflowjs) I will try with it.
Extra: A-Frame--> Change the red horizontal box with Rugby goal --> I did a Rugby goal with 3d program called Blender.
& include motor physics (by Natalia Monforte). --> Not yet





The next week goals are:
