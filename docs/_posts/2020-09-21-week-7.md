This week I had to do:

1. Refine Acustic Teleoperator: 

Include a fence or wall or futbol goal ---> I include this but i want to change it for another with more 3d effects

Try Teleoperator with training model, record examples.  --> I want to change the model becasuse it not works good, and maybe we have to include a botton 	   for click on it when you say to the robot what to do. The robot with this model gets a little crazy and the probability of success is low. 
	
Also, try Physics Motor of Natalia Monforte. --> I will try this week, I have not been able to try it yet.

2. Inicial soundtrack in JavaScript Editor. --> It works but where I have to include my audio.js in the folder js/ or in build/ ? or simcore? now is in javascript-editor/ with the index.html
