This week I had to do:

1. Optimize Acustic Teleoperator including a Vumeter/Studing Teacheble Machine and how works recognizer.listen()
I tried some things and I can't analize or duplicate the stream for Teachable Machine beacuse recognizer.listen() include getUserMedia and I can't change it. I couldn't use the VU because I can not use two streams of audio.
Despite this I have tried to optimize my Acustic Teleoperator with a counter, I thought that count the times the model predict _background_noise_ could optimize my model.
What I have done is counting the times that the model predicts background_noise and if it detect about 10  times in a row, the model stops predicting and I added a continue analizing button if you need to start the recognition again.


This is how it works:
